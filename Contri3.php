				<h2 class="headline-our">OUR EFFORTS</h2>
				<p>Trees help us reduce respiratory problems, and many other health-related issues. 
				   You begin to feel fresh, cool and nice. 
				   This shows that trees are not only physically useful for us but also mentally essential.
				   Among the projects we have initiated is a new project called Coastal Projects where 
				   we plant coastal mangroves around Sri Lanka such as coconut saplings to prevent seawater stagnant 
				   sea erosion and plant adaptation to the soil composition associated with it.We carried out projects on
				   beaches that attracted tourists such as Bentota, Galle and Hikkaduwa.
